## TP 4 Notes

- Took a while to adjust to the s,t axis.
- A bit difficult to map texture coordinates on each piece of the tangram to the image, when considering their transformations on the tangram class. If we were to re-do it, we would isolate each piece, without rotations and map the texture coordinates then.
- In exercise 2, it was a bit tricky knowing how exactly to apply the texture to each face of the cube, however the doubt quickly faded when we realized the technique was similar to the matrices operations used while making the quad unit cube - apply the texture to each face, individually, after each matrix transformation.
