## TP 3 Notes

- Part 1
  - The cube's normals are facing (1, 1, 1). The tangram disapears when normals are enabled in the GUI.
  - Ambient lighting in the tangram and the cube is consistent with the other objects. 
  - Difuse lighting affects different parts of the tangram differently, in particular the parallelogram which is in umbra. The edges of each shape that compose the tangram are also more noticible.
  - In the cube, faces that dont face the light 1 are brighter than those facing it, in difuse lighting.
  - In specullar lighting, the shapes of the tangram are only visible a light is behind it and very close to it. The cube is also only visible when a light is behind it.
  - Specular Light on the Cylinder transitions more smoothly between slices than on the prism.
  - Difficulty in setting the diamonds normals
  - Difficulty in displaying blue specular lights
